# Clarity
Clarity is an open-source behavioral analytics library written in typescript, with two key goals: privacy & performance. 

It helps you understand how users view and use your website across all modern devices and browsers. Understanding how users navigate, interact and browse your website can provide new insights about your users. Empathizing with your users and seeing where features fail or succeed can help improve your product, grow revenue and improve user retention.

It's the same code that powers Microsoft's hosted behavioral analytics solution: <a href="https://clarity.microsoft.com">https://clarity.microsoft.com</a>. If you would like to see a demo of how it works, checkout <a href="https://clarity.microsoft.com/demo/projects/view/3t0wlogvdz/impressions?date=Last%203%20days">live demo</a>. 

We encourage the community to join us in building the best behavioral analytics library, that puts privacy first and prioritizes performance. 

Happy coding!
